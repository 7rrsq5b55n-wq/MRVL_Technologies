# Drop Pilot Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** [PUT DATE HERE]

Drop Pilot (“we”, “our”, “us”) is a delivery routing and navigation helper app.

## Data We Collect
### Location
- **When in use:** We use your device location to show your position on the map and calculate routes.
- **Background (if enabled):** If you allow “Always” location, we may access location in the background to support navigation/trip tracking while the app is not on screen.

### Stops / Addresses You Enter
We process the addresses/stops you import or type to:
- geocode addresses into coordinates
- calculate routes and ETAs

## How We Use Data
We use data only to provide app functionality:
- mapping, routing, and navigation
- route optimization and route summaries

## Third-Party Services
Drop Pilot uses Google APIs (e.g., Maps, Geocoding, Directions) to calculate routes and display maps. Those services may receive address/location data necessary to fulfill requests.

## Data Storage
- Stops and route data may be stored locally on your device (e.g., for rounds/history).
- We do not sell your personal data.

## Sharing
We do not share your personal data with third parties except as required to provide core features (e.g., mapping/routing providers).

## Your Choices
- You can deny location permission, but route/navigation features may not work fully.
- You can disable background location in iOS Settings at any time.
